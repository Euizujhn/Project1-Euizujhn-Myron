IT1.Code was about extracting user & timestamp information form the Video Game Wikipedia.

IT2.GUI was implemented to the project, Interface class uses Javafx gui to enter wikipedia search, shows error if wikipedia is not avaliable, can go back to previous page. Class was then launched in the MainApp Class.
